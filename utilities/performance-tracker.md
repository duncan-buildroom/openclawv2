## 3. Monthly Dashboard

### Key Metrics to Track Monthly
- **Total followers gained** (net, from TikTok analytics)
- **Total carousel views** (sum)
- **Average views per carousel**
- **Best-performing category** (by avg views)
- **Best-performing hook formula** (by avg engagement rate)
- **Save rate** (total saves / total views × 100)
- **Comment rate** (total comments / total views × 100)
- **Profile visits from carousels** (TikTok analytics)
- **Link clicks** (if using link in bio)
- **Build Room signups attributed to TikTok** (track via UTM or ask in onboarding)

### Monthly Review Questions
1. Which category consistently gets the most saves? (Double down)
2. Which hook formula drives the most comments? (Use more)
3. Are we hitting the 2-post/day target? If not, what's the bottleneck?
4. What time slots perform best? (Adjust posting schedule)
5. Are AI-generated images passing the realism test? (Check comments for "AI" callouts)
6. Is there a correlation between real screenshot slides and higher saves?
7. What topics are people asking about in comments? (Content ideas)

## 4. Hook Performance Matrix

Track which hook formulas perform best over time:

| Hook Formula | Times Used | Avg Views | Avg Saves | Avg Comments | Win Rate | Status |

| "This one n8n workflow does..." | 0 | — | — | — | — | UNTESTED |
| "My client [name] automated..." | 0 | — | — | — | — | UNTESTED |
| "[X] tools connected. Zero manual..." | 0 | — | — | — | — | UNTESTED |

## 5. A/B Testing Protocol

### How to Test
1. **Same content, different hooks:** Take one carousel concept, create 2-3 hook variations
2. Post variant A on Day 1, variant B on Day 3 (same time slot)
3. Compare views and engagement after 72 hours
4. Winner gets used again; loser goes to failure log

### What to Test (Priority Order)
1. **Hook text** (highest impact — test first)
2. **Slide 1 image type** (AI-generated vs text-on-dark vs screenshot)
3. **Slide count** (6 vs 8 vs 10)
4. **Caption length** (short vs detailed)
5. **CTA type** ("Follow" vs "Comment WORD" vs "Save this")
6. **Posting time** (morning vs evening)
7. **Music choice** (trending vs chill ambient)

### Testing Log

| Test # | Variable | Variant A | Variant B | A Views | B Views | A Saves | B Saves | Winner | Lesson |
|--------|----------|-----------|-----------|---------|---------|---------|---------|--------|--------|
| _template_ | _Hook_ | _"Hook A"_ | _"Hook B"_ | — | — | — | — | — | — |

## 8. Competitor / Niche Benchmarks

### Who to Watch

## 9. Revenue Attribution

Track which carousels drive actual business results:

| Post # | Date | Hook | Profile Visits | Link Clicks | DMs Received | Build Room Signups | Revenue | Notes |
|--------|------|------|---------------|-------------|--------------|-------------------|---------|-------|
| _template_ | — | — | — | — | — | — | — | — |

### Attribution Methods
1. **UTM links** in bio (switch per campaign)
2. **Ask in onboarding** — "How did you find us?" → track "TikTok" responses
3. **DM tracking** — Log DMs that reference specific carousel content
4. **Comment-to-DM conversion** — Track "Comment [WORD]" → DM → signup flow

## 10. Automation Ideas

### What Can Be Automated (n8n / Make)
- [ ] Auto-capture TikTok analytics daily → append to Google Sheet
- [ ] Weekly performance email digest (top post, worst post, trends)
- [ ] Follower milestone alerts (75K, 80K, 85K, 90K, 100K)
- [ ] Comment sentiment analysis on new carousels
- [ ] Auto-generate weekly review template from data
- [ ] Cross-post performance comparison (same carousel on TikTok vs IG vs LinkedIn)
- [ ] Content calendar auto-population based on winner categories

### Workflow: Auto-Track TikTok Analytics
```
Trigger: Daily at 11 PM PST
→ Playwright: Open TikTok Analytics
→ Screenshot: Capture key metrics
→ OCR/Parse: Extract numbers
→ Google Sheets: Append row
