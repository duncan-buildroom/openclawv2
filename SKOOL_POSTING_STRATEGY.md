## Rules

1. **NEVER post the same content in multiple communities**
2. **NEVER mention Build Room, link, or CTA in other communities**
3. **Profile does the selling** (bio + pinned content)
4. Each post must be tailored to the community's specific audience and topic
5. Engagement posts (polls, questions) work everywhere
6. Value posts must reference Duncan's real numbers and experience
