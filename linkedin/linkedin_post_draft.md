# LinkedIn Post - The Autopilot Stack

## Main Post

4 cron jobs run my entire business while I sleep.

Here's what happens between midnight and 7am (without me):

I built these in 48 hours. Now they run 24/7 for ~$5/day.

**What executes automatically:**
• 7:00 AM — Morning briefing lands in my inbox (trends, priorities, what needs attention)
• 12:00 AM — Daily tracker logs everything (revenue, growth, decisions)
• 12:00 AM — GitHub backup runs (entire workspace, versioned, safe)
• 11:00 PM Sunday — Trend research compiles the week's signals

I wake up to a briefing. My workspace is backed up. Trends are researched.

Zero manual work.

These exact 4 jobs helped me grow to 110K+ followers. Not because they post for me—because they free my brain for the work that actually matters.
