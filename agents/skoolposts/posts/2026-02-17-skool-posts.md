## Post 1

**Title:** I spent $200 this weekend so you don't have to

**Body:**
I literally spent $200 this weekend testing OpenClaw and at some point Sunday night I just started laughing at myself. The thing is, I was routing every single task — even stuff like summarizing a webpage — through the most expensive model available. Totally unnecessary. Once I set up model routing so that simple tasks hit cheaper models and only the heavy reasoning stuff hit the flagship model, my daily cost dropped from $50+ down to about $5. Same output, one config change.

**Title:** The two-word instruction that made my AI agent actually useful

**Body:**
I set up an AI agent last week and honestly it was kind of useless at first. Not broken — just annoying. Every five minutes it was asking me to clarify something, waiting for permission, stopping mid-task to check in. I was still doing half the work. Then I added a single directive at the top of the system prompt: "Figure It Out." Told it to make reasonable assumptions and keep moving unless it hit a genuine blocker. The thing went from a needy intern to something that actually runs while I sleep.

**Title:** My lead magnet flopped for three weeks then this happened

**Body:**
So I've been really trying to nail my lead magnet strategy and I spent three full weeks building what I thought was a genuinely useful resource. Conversion rate was embarrassing. The problem wasn't the quality — it was that it tried to solve too many things at once. I stripped it down, made it solve one hyper-specific problem, and set up ManyChat so people could get it just by commenting "AI" on a post. That version outperformed the original in about two hours. Specific beats comprehensive every time.

**Title:** I stopped staring at a blank page on Monday mornings

**Body:**
I used to spend my Monday mornings staring at a blank page trying to figure out what to even post about that week. Just burning time and feeling stuck. The fix was almost stupidly simple — I built a little pipeline that pulls trending threads from Reddit, YouTube comments, and X every Sunday night and drops them into a doc for me. I wake up Monday with a week's worth of angles already surfaced. I didn't have to come up with an idea today. The internet already did it.

## Post 5

**Title:** What I wish someone told me at zero followers

**Body:**
Honestly for the first few months I was just posting whatever I thought was cool — design stuff, random thoughts, AI experiments. Barely moved the needle. The thing I didn't get was that I wasn't talking to anyone specific. Once I got really clear on one person with one problem I could actually help — someone trying to use AI to build a business without a tech background — everything clicked. Went from invisible to 110K followers in under 12 months. The niche didn't limit me. It was the only thing that actually worked.
