They post about \"productivity\" or \"marketing\" or \"AI\" — and wonder why no one cares. You're competing with millions.\n\n**The fix:** Find the intersection of your skills that NO ONE else has. That's your unfair advantage.\n\n---\n\n### **Prompt 1: The Unfair Advantage Finder**\n\n```\nI want to build authority in [your industry]. Here's my background:\n- Professional experience: [list 3-5 roles/companies]\n- Skills: [list 3-5 core skills]\n- Wins: [list 2-3 measurable results]\n- Audience I serve: [describe ideal client]\n\nAnalyze my experience and identify 3 unique positioning angles that combine my background in ways most people can't replicate. For each: what makes it unique, who it appeals to, content themes. Format as a table.\n```\n\n**What it unlocks:** You stop competing with millions. You own a space of hundreds.\n\n---\n\n### **Prompt 2: The One-Liner Generator**\n\n```\nMy positioning: [paste from Prompt 1]\nMy proof: [2-3 measurable results]\nMy offer: [what you're driving traffic to]\n\nWrite 5 one-liner bios:\n\"I help [audience] achieve [outcome] using [method] — [proof].\"\n\nPunchy. Specific. Credible. No fluff.\n```\n\n**What it unlocks:** Someone reads your bio and instantly knows if you're for them. Clarity = conversion.\n\n---\n\n**Why this comes first:** If you're not positioned, your content is just noise. Once you're positioned, everything you create reinforces your authority.",

Here's how.\n\n---\n\n### **Prompt 3: The Hook Generator**\n\n```\nTopic: [what you want to talk about]\nAudience: [who you're speaking to]\nGoal: [educate/inspire/sell]\n\nWrite 10 hooks using:\n1. Specific number + outcome\n2. Contrarian take\n3. Mistake-based\n4. Before/after\n5.

Pick the best 2.\n\n---\n\n### **Prompt 4: The Carousel Outliner**\n\n```\nTopic: [your idea]\nAudience: [who this is for]\nKey takeaway: [main point]\n\nCreate a 7-slide carousel:\n- Slide 1: Hook\n- Slides 2-5: Core content (one idea per slide, <20 words)\n- Slide 6: Proof or example\n- Slide 7: CTA\n\nShort sentences. No fluff.\n```\n\n**What it unlocks:** Carousels get 3x the engagement of text posts. One idea becomes visual. Paste into Canva. Post.\n\n---\n\n### **Prompt 5: The Video Script Generator**\n\n```\nTopic: [your idea]\nHook: [opening line]\nLength: [30/60/90 seconds]\n\nWrite a video script:\n- 0:00-0:03: HOOK (scroll-stopper)\n- Next 10-20 sec: Problem/tension\n- Next 20-40 sec: Solution/insight\n- Final 5-10 sec: CTA\n\nFormat: [VISUAL CUE] Voiceover text\nFast-paced.

TikTok, Reels, Shorts — same script, different platform.\n\n---\n\n### **Prompt 6: The Voice Calibration Prompt**\n\n```\nHere are 5 posts I've written that sound like ME:\n[Paste 5 samples]\n\nAnalyze my style:\n1. Sentence structure\n2. Vocabulary choices\n3. Tone\n4. Rhythm\n5. Unique quirks\n\nGive me a \"voice profile\" I can paste into future prompts.\n```\n\n**What it unlocks:** AI stops sounding generic. It writes like YOU. Run this once. Paste the profile into every future prompt.\n\n---\n\n**Why this comes next:** You have positioning. Now you have volume. But posting 15x/week on one platform won't scale. That's where distribution comes in.",
