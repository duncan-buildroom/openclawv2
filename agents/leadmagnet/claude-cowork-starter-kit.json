      "content": "Claude Cowork is not Claude Chat. It's a separate mode inside the Claude desktop app. You give it access to specific folders on your computer, set a task, and walk away. Claude breaks the work into steps, executes them in an isolated virtual machine on your machine, and pings you before doing anything destructive. It's like hiring an assistant who works on your files while you're in a meeting.\n\nCowork is in research preview right now. It's available to anyone with a paid Claude account (Pro at $20/mo, Max at $100-200/mo, or Team at $20/seat). It can connect to cloud tools like Slack, Notion, and GitHub. It has plugins for specialized tasks. And it pairs with a Chrome extension so Claude can work in your browser.\n\nThe big difference? Chat is back and forth. Cowork is set it and forget it.\n\nIf you've been copying and pasting between Claude and your files all day, you've been doing it the hard way.",

      "content": "Here's the simple breakdown:\n\nChat: You want answers, ideas, or help writing something. You're having a conversation. You ask, Claude responds, you refine. Good for brainstorming, learning, editing copy, asking questions.\n\nCowork: You have a task that involves your files. You want Claude to do the work while you do something else. You point it at a folder and describe the outcome you want. Good for organizing files, drafting documents from notes, cleaning up folders, batch processing.\n\nCode: You're writing or editing code in a specific codebase. You want Claude to understand your project structure and make changes across multiple files. Good for debugging, refactoring, building features.\n\nThe mistake most people make? They use Chat for everything. They copy files into Chat, ask Claude to process them, then copy the output back. That works, but it's slow. If you're doing that more than twice for the same type of task, switch to Cowork.\n\nCowork is best when the task is repetitive, involves multiple files, or takes more than 5 steps. Chat is best when you need to think out loud or iterate quickly on one thing.",

      "story_beat": "Show them exactly what works. Real tasks, real prompts, no theory.",
      "content": "These are the tasks real users have reported success with. Not theory. Not what should work. What actually works.\n\n### 1. Clean Up Your Downloads Folder\n\nMost people have 500+ random files sitting in Downloads. Cowork can organize them in minutes.\n\n📋 Prompt to use:\n\"Go through my Downloads folder. Create subfolders by file type (Images, Documents, Videos, Archives, Other). Move each file into the right folder. Delete any files older than 6 months that are clearly junk (installers, duplicate screenshots, tmp files). Show me what you plan to delete before you do it.\"\n\n### 2. Turn Meeting Notes Into Polished Reports\n\nYou have a folder of raw notes from client calls or team meetings. You need them formatted and summarized.\n\n📋 Prompt to use:\n\"Read all the notes in the /meeting-notes folder. Create one summary document that organizes them by project. For each project, include key decisions, action items, and open questions. Format it as a clean report I can send to my team.\"\n\n### 3. Convert Screenshots Into Spreadsheets\n\nYou have receipts, invoices, or data tables in image form. You need them in a spreadsheet.\n\n📋 Prompt to use:\n\"Look at all the images in the /receipts folder. Extract the data from each one (date, vendor, amount, category). Create a CSV file with columns for Date, Vendor, Amount, Category, and Notes. If anything is unclear, flag it in the Notes column.\"\n\n### 4. Draft Marketing Content From a Brand Voice Folder\n\nYou have examples of your writing style. You need new posts, emails, or landing page copy that sounds like you.\n\n📋 Prompt to use:\n\"Read everything in my /brand-voice folder. Learn how I write — tone, structure, word choice. Then draft 10 LinkedIn posts about [your topic]. Match my style exactly. Each post should be 150-200 words, start with a hook, and end with a clear takeaway.\"\n\n### 5. Create Daily Briefings From Multiple Sources\n\nYou want a morning summary of what happened in Slack, what's on your calendar, and what GitHub issues need attention.\n\n📋 Prompt to use:\n\"Connect to my Slack workspace, Google Calendar, and GitHub. Every morning, create a briefing document that includes: (1) Slack messages I was mentioned in or DMs I received, (2) Calendar events for today and tomorrow, (3) GitHub issues assigned to me or updated in the last 24 hours. Save it as a new file in /briefings with today's date as the filename.\"\n\nThese five tasks cover 80% of what Cowork does well right now. Start with one. Get it working. Then add the next.",

      "content": "Real talk: people have lost files using Cowork. Not because it's broken, but because they gave it access to everything and said yes to a destructive action without reading it.\n\nHere's how to avoid that:\n\nCreate a dedicated Cowork folder. Don't point Claude at your entire Documents folder or your Desktop. Make a new folder called /Cowork-Workspace. Put copies of the files you want it to work on in there. Work from copies until you trust it.\n\nNever give access to your entire drive. When Cowork asks what folders it can access, be specific. Give it one folder at a time. You can always add more later.\n\nStart with read-only tasks. Your first few tasks should be things like \"summarize these files\" or \"create a report from these notes.\" Not \"delete,\" \"move,\" or \"rename.\" Get comfortable with how it works before you let it change things.\n\nAlways review before approving destructive actions. Cowork will show you what it plans to delete, move, or overwrite. Read it. If you're not sure, say no. You can refine the task and try again.\n\nThe people who have the best experience with Cowork treat it like a junior employee. You wouldn't let a new hire delete your entire project folder on day one. Same rule applies here.",

Your content system runs whether you're working or not.\n\nInside Build Room, we've built entire Cowork plugins for content workflows.
