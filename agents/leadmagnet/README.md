## 🎨 Style Guide

**Tone:** Direct, compressed, Hormozi-style. No fluff. Operator energy.

**Formatting:**
- Emojis for agent icons (🧠 🔍 ✍️ 📋 🔧)
- Blue/gray callouts for important blocks
- Toggle blocks for expandable content
- Checkboxes for action items
- Code blocks for the master prompt

## ✨ What Makes This Special

**Not a template.** This is a working system.

Every SOUL.md file is complete. The orchestrator knows how to delegate. The specialists know their jobs. The handoff patterns are defined.

Copy → Paste → Deploy → Use.

No "TODO" sections. No placeholder text. No "you'll need to configure X."

It works out of the box.

## 🔧 Technical Details

**File structure:**
```
/main/
  SOUL.md (orchestrator)
  AGENTS.md (registry)
  USER.md (customization)
  TOOLS.md

/researcher/
  SOUL.md
  TOOLS.md

/writer/
  SOUL.md
  TOOLS.md

/chief/
  SOUL.md
  TOOLS.md

/builder/
  SOUL.md
  TOOLS.md
```

**Agent communication:**
- Orchestrator spawns specialists with clear instructions
- Specialists complete task and return output
- Orchestrator delivers results to user
- Multi-step workflows coordinate sequentially

**Memory system:**
- Daily logs in `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- Long-term memory in `MEMORY.md` (main session only)
- Each agent learns and adapts over time

## 📈 Upgrade Path

**Start with the 5 core agents.**

When ready to scale, add:
- **Publisher** (social media automation)
- **Designer** (visual content creation)
- **Strategist** (high-level planning)
- **Analyst** (data and metrics)

Each follows the same pattern: SOUL.md + AGENTS.md entry.
