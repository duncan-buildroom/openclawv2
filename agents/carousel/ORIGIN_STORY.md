## THE COPY

---

> Apple. PlayStation. Nissan. Charles Schwab.
>
> I built cool shit for other people.
>
> That was the problem.

**Shot:** Establishing. SF skyline from Sausalito waterfront. Late afternoon gold. Still water reflecting the city. No people. Fog creeping over the hills.

---

### SLIDE 3 — THE SWITCH

> **Then I walked away.**
>
> Left the creative career in 2023.
> Found AI automation. Went all in. Solo.

**Shot:** Character. Duncan at Alameda shoreline, sitting on a seawall. Looking out toward the Bay and SF skyline. Three-quarter profile. Golden hour. Quiet, not dramatic.

>
> Automation mastery, expert positioning, personal branding.
>
> Guarantee: first leads in 14 days.

**Shot:** Establishing. Wide shot from Marin Headlands hilltop. Golden Gate in frame. Bay spread below. Green coastal hills. Fog rolling over from the Pacific. Expansive.

---

### SLIDE 6 — WHERE EVERYTHING LIVES

> **Here's where to find everything.**
>
> The Build Room (Skool) — community + training

> 30 free automations — link in bio

**Shot:** Establishing. Sausalito waterfront street scene, late afternoon. Colorful storefronts, marina in background. Warm light. No people in foreground.

*Note: The list separators use dashes, not em dashes. If you prefer commas — "The Build Room (Skool), community + training" — either version reads clean.*

---

### SLIDE 7 — WHAT'S NEXT

> **I'm documenting what comes next.**
>
> The wins. The failures. The experiments.
>
> All of it, here.
>
> Follow along.

**Shot:** Character. Duncan walking toward the Golden Gate Bridge, shot from behind and to the left. Morning fog. Bridge towers barely visible through haze. Orange hoodie. Mid-stride, not posed. The path ahead disappears into fog.

---

### SLIDE 8 — CTA

> **Comment "AI" below.**
>
> I'll send you my 30 best automations.
> Free.

**Shot:** Character. Duncan at Alameda shoreline, golden hour. Facing camera, slight smile. Orange hoodie. Bay water behind him, catching late light. Most approachable shot in the carousel.

## COPY NOTES

**What's working:**
- Slide 2 ends on "That was the problem." — that phrase creates enough tension to earn slide 3. Don't bury it.
- Slide 3: "Went all in. Solo." — the period between those two creates a pause. Don't merge them into one sentence.
- Slide 4: Five bullets is a lot for a slide. If text clipping is an issue, split into two slides: one for audience growth + revenue, one for income + templates. But five reads fast as a list — test it first.
- Slide 7: "The failures." is intentional. Including it earns trust in a way "The wins" alone doesn't.
- Slide 8: "Free." on its own line. Don't merge it with the sentence above.

**Swap notes for real photos:**
- Slides 1, 3, 7, 8 are character shots — swap for actual photos of Duncan in Bay Area locations
- Slides 2, 5, 6 are establishing shots — swap for real Bay Area landscape photos
- Slide 4 is a detail shot — swap for real laptop/workspace photo, or use a results screenshot

**Voice check:**
- ✅ No em dashes (narrative punctuation)
- ✅ No motivational filler ("level up," "unlock," etc.)
- ✅ Short sentences throughout
- ✅ Proof over persuasion (brand names, dollar figures, follower counts)
- ✅ "I built cool shit for other people" — kept the exact phrase from the brief
