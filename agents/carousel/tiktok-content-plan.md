# TikTok Carousel Content Plan — Research + 15 Content Briefs
**Owner:** Duncan Rogoff (@duncanrogoff)
**Created:** 2026-02-13
**Scope:** Initial launch batch for the expanded niche (automation + expert positioning + audience building)

---

## PART 1: Research Summary

### Duncan's TikTok Profile Analysis
- **Handle:** @duncanrogoff
- **Followers:** ~68K-75K (fluctuates; profile shows 68.1K on some trackers, self-reported 75K)
- **Total Likes:** 709.4K+
- **Bio:** "Start, run and grow your AI agency" (NOTE: needs updating to match new positioning)
- **Content history:** Primarily short-form video — tutorials, pep talks, automation demos

### Top-Performing Content Themes (Based on Research)
1. **Viral cloning/automation** — "12M views. One automation. 4 minutes." (LinkedIn post about cloning Michael Jackson TikTok and repurposing across platforms) — This theme of "clone what's working with AI" consistently drives engagement
2. **"100 TikToks in 60 minutes"** — Mass content generation with AI tools (Opus Pro, n8n). Published on Medium + promoted across channels. Volume + speed hooks perform well.
3. **"It's SO EASY to go viral"** — TikTok video about cloning viral Twitter posts with AI automation. Direct how-to with proof.
4. **Gemini 3 Pro viral cloning** — YouTube tutorial on using Gemini + n8n to analyze, clone, and redistribute TikTok videos. Technical + practical.
5. **"This Easy AI Trick Gets 100K Views Every Time"** — YouTube video promising consistent results from a proven format. Specific number + repeatability hook.
6. **Content repurposing workflows** — n8n automation that takes one video → creates content for Instagram, TikTok, LinkedIn, Twitter, YouTube automatically.

### Pattern Analysis: What Works for Duncan
| Signal | Pattern |
|--------|---------|
| **Highest views** | Specific numbers in hooks ("12M views," "100 TikToks," "100K views") |
| **Highest engagement** | Proof-based content (screenshots, real results, before/after) |
| **Best format** | How-to with visible automation (screen recordings, workflow screenshots) |
| **Audience response** | People want the SYSTEM, not the theory — "give me the workflow" |
| **Viral triggers** | Speed/volume claims ("60 minutes," "4 minutes"), impossibility hooks ("SO EASY") |
| **Weak signals** | Generic AI tips without proof, talking-head without visual proof |

### Key Insight for Carousel Pivot
Duncan's video content succeeds through **visible systems + specific numbers**. Carousels can amplify this by making each slide a proof point that people save and share. The swipe format naturally fits his "step-by-step system" teaching style.

### Niche Trend Analysis (Automation + Audience Building, 2025-2026)
- **TikTok carousels outperform video** — 1.9x more likes, 2.9x more comments, 81% higher engagement rate
- **"Expert-to-audience" niche is exploding** — Hormozi, Brunson, and mid-tier educators all shifting to "help experts become known"
- **AI-proof content** — Real screenshots and specific workflows can't be faked, building trust in an increasingly AI-skeptical environment
- **B2B on TikTok is growing** — Business owners 30-55 are the fastest-growing TikTok demographic
- **Photo Mode is algorithmically boosted** — TikTok has been actively pushing creators toward carousels since 2024
- **Saves are the new shares** — For carousel content, save rate is the #1 indicator of quality and reach

One call later: $4,750.

|-------|---------|------------|
| 1 — Hook | "The biggest lie in content creation: 'just be consistent.'" | AI: Dark background + text, slightly angled phone showing social media |

**Caption:**
```
"Just be consistent" is the laziest advice in content.

I've watched people post every day for a year and never break 200 followers. Consistency without strategy is posting into the void.

What matters: RIGHT topic + RIGHT format + RIGHT positioning.

I never post without researching what's already working. That's how one video hit 5M views.

Save this before you post again.

You don't need to dance on TikTok. You need to share what you know using systems that work.

Comment EXPERT — I'll send you the framework.
