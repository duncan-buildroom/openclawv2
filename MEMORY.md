- Purpose: Permanent storage for carousel images and assets.
- Config: `GOOGLE_DRIVE_CONFIG.md` (includes API key)

## 🧠 Permanent Skills & Protocols

### Carousel Protocol (v8) - Feb 14, 2026
- **Process doc:** `CAROUSEL_PROCESS.md` — the single source of truth for the full pipeline
- **Workflow:** Carousel Agent (copy) → Orchestrator (screenshots + infographic validation) → Imgen Agent (SEALCAM → Nano Banana → styling) → Orchestrator (format validate → fix errors → upload imgur → push Notion)
- **Visual Theme System:** 50 themes in `CAROUSEL_THEMES.md`, randomized, no repeat within last 5. Carousel agent reads file before every carousel.
- **Shot Types (strict):** character, establishing, detail, screenshot, composite, infographic
- **⚠️ NEVER squash workflow screenshots.** Scale proportionally + center crop to target dimensions. No stretching/distortion. Ever.
- **MANDATORY per carousel:** ≥1 real n8n screenshot + ≥1 infographic + 2-3 character shots
- **Quality gate:** Orchestrator fixes ALL errors (text clipping, format, etc.) BEFORE showing Duncan. Never present broken work.
- **Global CTA:** Comment "AI" to trigger the 30 Best Automations funnel
- **Reference:** `IMAGE_STYLING_GUIDE.md`, `CAROUSEL_PROCESS.md`

### Social Image Generator (LOCKED)
- **Path:** `/data/.openclaw/workspace/SKILL_SOCIAL_IMAGE_GENERATOR.md`
- **Protocol:** Nano Banana Pro (Likeness) -> Image Styling System (Typography).
- **Hard Constraints:** Roboto font, 80px left-offset, white text + soft drop shadow, no outlines, no background boxes, 4:5 ratio (Twitter/IG).
- **Reference:** Always use `reference-photos/DuncanReference.jpeg` for Duncan's likeness (4-angle sheet: front, side, back, three-quarter, orange hoodie). Imgur: https://i.imgur.com/vc7pPOC.jpeg
- **Copy Rule:** Specific, concrete, simple (No vagueness).

## Lead Magnet Agent (Feb 15, 2026)

**Agent ID:** `leadmagnet`
**Model:** Claude Sonnet 4.6 (upgraded from 4.5 on Feb 17)
**Workspace:** `/data/.openclaw/workspace/agents/leadmagnet/`
**Research:** `/data/.openclaw/workspace/leadmagnet_research_2025.md`
**ICP:** People building followings/audiences to drive traffic to an offer using AI
**Key principles:** Story-driven (not lists), Notion-native, uncommon specificity, proprietary frameworks, progressive disclosure, beautiful design
**Hard constraint:** 1,500 words MAX per lead magnet. No exceptions. Concise > comprehensive.
**Top formats:** Interactive Notion databases (8-15 min engagement), swipe files with context, decision frameworks, behind-the-scenes walkthroughs
**Output:** Structured JSON with section-by-section Notion design specs

**⚠️ CRITICAL:** Lead magnets must NOT require learning a skill set. No automation tutorials, no n8n/Make how-tos. Knowledge-first: prompt packs, AI playbooks, system prompt templates, frameworks, swipe files, guides. Everything copy-paste ready, zero tool dependencies.

**⚠️ CRITICAL:** ALWAYS research the topic before building a lead magnet. Check Reddit, YouTube, Twitter — how are real people talking about and using this thing? Never build on assumptions. A lead magnet based on wrong info is worse than no lead magnet.

**First lead magnet:** "The AI Authority Playbook™" — `/data/.openclaw/workspace/agents/leadmagnet/playbook-v4.json` (4 sections, 8 prompts, 1,500 words)
- Notion: https://www.notion.so/The-AI-Authority-Playbook-308f259c0f178128a8f8f1280c145631
- Prompts in 📋 callout blocks for easy copy-paste

## Road to $1M Series (Feb 18, 2026)

**Full strategy guide:** `SKOOL_POSTING_STRATEGY.md` (13 active communities, voice rules per community, cross-posting strategy)

**CTA rule (ALL platforms):** Always "The Build Room, link in bio." NEVER "comment AI" or individual lead magnet CTAs. One destination.
**Build Room:** Always capitalized "The Build Room", always hyperlinked to https://skool.com/buildroom in Notion. It's $97/mo, NOT free. Say "everything I build, you get" not "every asset is free."
**X agent CTA updated** in agents/threads/SOUL.md

**Reddit credentials:** LIVE. u/Drogoff1489, 1,706 link karma. Creds in `.credentials`. Using praw.

**Unified Notion DB:** Road to $1M `30bf259c-0f17-8138-b849-f25efdc0b4b0` — one row per day, page body has sections per platform. Replaces separate X/LinkedIn/Carousel DBs for new content.

**Tweet queue cron:** `75d54d9e` — checks every 30 min, auto-posts due tweets via post_due_tweets.sh

**Bio strategy:** Discovery platforms (TikTok, X) = "Everything I build, you get." Conversion platforms (YouTube, Instagram, LinkedIn) = specific promise ("New leads + 1,500 followers in 49 days").

## Models Configured

**Default:** Gemini 3 Flash Preview (everyday, 90% cost reduction)
**Content/writing sub-agents:** Claude Sonnet 4.6 (leadmagnet, linkedin, trendanalyst) — upgraded from 4.5 on Feb 17, 2026
**Heavy tasks:** Claude Opus 4.6 (main orchestrator, complex multi-step reasoning only when Sonnet 4.6 isn't enough)
**Fallbacks:** Claude Sonnet 4.6, Claude Opus 4.6, ChatGPT 5.2

### Model Selection Guide (Feb 17, 2026)
**Sonnet 4.6 replaces Sonnet 4.5 everywhere.** Same price ($3/$15 per M tokens), major upgrades:
- Approaches Opus-level on most tasks (users preferred it over Opus 4.5 59% of the time)
- 1M token context window (beta)
- Much better coding, instruction following, long-context reasoning
- Better at frontend code, financial analysis, document comprehension
- Less overengineering, fewer hallucinations than Sonnet 4.5

**When to use Opus 4.6 vs Sonnet 4.6:**
- Opus: Only for the most complex multi-step reasoning, heavy architecture decisions, or when Sonnet 4.6 produces insufficient results
- Sonnet 4.6: Writing, content, analysis, moderate coding, agent planning, design — basically everything that isn't peak complexity
- Rule: Try Sonnet 4.6 first. Escalate to Opus only if quality is insufficient.

**Full pipeline doc:** `TREND_RESEARCH_PIPELINE.md` (data sources, query rotation, page layout, troubleshooting)

## X/Twitter Strategy (Feb 17, 2026)

**Agent:** `threads` (expanded to full X management — tweets, threads, replies, engagement, cross-posting)
**Profile:** @DuncanRogoff, verified ✓, X Premium, 19.3K followers, User ID 1372291578748837889
**Bio:** Ex - Apple, PlayStation, Nissan | AI agency founder | 110K followers in 12 months | Teaching 2,000+ to build an audience using AI 👇
**Positioning:** 110K followers in 12 months. AI agency founder. Offer: More new leads + 1,500 followers + ALL my resources.
**Pinned thread:** https://x.com/DuncanRogoff/status/2023958488670470207 (Claude 4.6 Prompt Pack, 7 tweets)

**Scripts:** engagement_monitor.py, following_cleanse.py, repurpose_pipeline.py, fetch_remix_candidates.py, tweet_scheduler.py

**Tweet voice rules (CRITICAL):**
- Documenting > teaching. Write like sharing what happened, not giving tips.
- First person, concrete details (say "Claude Opus" not "expensive model")
- Every tweet needs a HOOK ("This one shift 10x'd my growth")
- NEVER post multiple tweets back-to-back. Always use scheduler.

**Engagement reply rules (CRITICAL):**
- Max 35 words, single paragraph, no line breaks, no em dashes
- 6th grade reading level, coffee-with-a-peer tone
- Dig at real tension, not surface-level. Be concrete.
- Auto-posted, NO approval needed. Daily summary at 6pm.

---

## Important Patterns

**⚠️ Notion Formatting Rules (PERMANENT):**
- NEVER pass markdown bold (`**text**`) in Notion API content strings — Notion renders it as raw asterisks, not bold
- For bold text: use separate rich_text entries with `"bold": true` in annotations
- When pushing lead magnet JSON to Notion, the orchestrator's push script must parse `**text**` and convert to proper Notion bold annotations (use `parse_markdown_bold()` helper)
- All sub-agents that output Notion JSON must use rich_text annotations for formatting, not markdown syntax
- This caused a production issue on Feb 17, 2026 (Claude 4.6 Prompt Pack had raw asterisks throughout)

**ALWAYS auto-push to Notion (never ask):**
- Carousels → push slides + images to Notion Carousels DB immediately after imgen finishes
- Lead magnets → push to Notion Lead Magnets DB immediately after agent finishes
- LinkedIn posts → push to Notion LinkedIn DB immediately after agent finishes
- Trend analysis → push to Notion Trend Research DB immediately after agent finishes
- Notion IS where Duncan reviews. Don't ask "want me to push?" — just push and send the link.

**When working with Duncan:**
1. Read DUNCAN_PROFILE.md for comprehensive context when needed
2. Default to direct, compressed answers
3. Produce usable artifacts (schemas, templates, drafts) even if partial
4. Remove redundant phrasing automatically
5. Match output class: community post vs JSON schema vs debugging triage
6. Ask for missing data only when absolutely required
7. Spawn Opus 4.6 sub-agent for complex/heavy tasks (coding, multi-step reasoning, agent work)

**Content Philosophy (Feb 17, 2026):**
- Duncan's strategy is remixing already-proven content into his own voice, angle, and perspective
- NOT about "niching down" — it's about being strategic with what's already working
- Find what's trending/proven → put his unique spin on it → publish
- Trend research pipeline feeds this: Reddit/YouTube/X → Notion → pick angles → create

**Writing voice for community posts:**
- Café conversation tone — talking to a friend
- Words: "literally," "actually," "honestly," "the thing is"
- No em dashes — use commas instead
- Personal interjections: "I know you've probably heard this before but," "I thought this was stupid too"
- Acknowledge cliché before giving the advice (builds trust)
- Narrative arc: context/setup → problem → switch → result
- Titles: results-driven or direct instruction ("I spent $200 so you don't have to" / "If you don't know what to post, do this")

**Output classes Duncan produces:**
- Community posts (Hormozi-style)
- Short DMs (conversion, onboarding)
- Event descriptions (300-char constraint)
- Offer pages / positioning
- Prompt packs (image/video)
- Automation-ready JSON
- n8n/Make debugging triage
- Email sequences
- System prompts

## Image Styling System (Feb 2026)

**Established:** TikTok Carousel #001 - "Apple to 6-Figure Agency"
**Status:** Production system for all social image content

**Style Signature:**
- White text with soft drop shadow (not outline stroke)
- Roboto (bold for emphasis)
- Left-aligned, 80px margin (Ethan-style offset)
- Smart text placement (over buildings/open space, not subjects)
- Darkened backgrounds (85% brightness for contrast - 0.85 factor)
- Condensed copy (25-33% less than initial draft)
- NO background boxes, NO emojis

**Files:**
- `image_styling_system.py` - Core reusable engine
- `generate_twitter_thread.py` - Twitter thread generator
- `IMAGE_STYLING_GUIDE.md` - Full documentation

**Formats:**
- TikTok: 1080x1920 (9:16)
- Twitter: 1200x675 (16:9) or 1080x1350 (4:5)
- Instagram: 1080x1350 (4:5)
- LinkedIn: 1200x627

**Use for:** Twitter threads, TikTok carousels, Instagram posts, LinkedIn images, all social content

**Key Achievement:** Duncan recognized this as the template for all future image content, not just one-off carousel

## Image Hosting Strategy (Feb 2026, Updated)

**Primary: Google Drive Shared Drive (full quality, no compression)**
- Shared Drive ID: `0AATh9nGubtO1Uk9PVA`
- Service account: `/data/.openclaw/workspace/.secrets/google-drive-sa.json` (600 perms)
- Upload via Google Drive API v3, `supportsAllDrives=True`
- Direct URL: `https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/{file_id}`
- **⚠️ ONLY upload carousel images. No other Drive operations unless Duncan explicitly says so.**

**Fallback: Imgur (for Notion embeds only)**
- Anonymous API client ID: `546c25a59c58ad7`
- Imgur re-compresses large PNGs to JPEG (~50% quality loss)
- Use ONLY for Notion image embeds (Notion rejects Drive URLs as images)

**Retired:** 0x0.st, pomf.lain.la (403 errors)

**Documentation:** `IMAGE_HOSTING.md`, `CAROUSEL_PROCESS.md`

## Character Image Generation (Feb 2026)

**Pattern:** Casual lifestyle > tech displays

**Duncan's feedback:** "The multiple tech displays are too tech and not 'day in the life' enough."

**✅ Good prompts:**
- Coffee shop with laptop, natural lighting
- Modern loft with concrete pillars, arms crossed
- Walking through modern hallway, holding laptop
- Home office with plants, satisfied smile

**❌ Bad prompts:**
- Multiple monitors showing dashboards
- Tech setup with RGB lighting
- Standing in front of server racks
- Displaying analytics on screens

**Why:** Casual lifestyle feels authentic and relatable. Tech setups feel staged and promotional.

## Workflow Screenshot Process (Feb 2026)

**Pattern for carousels:**
- **Slide 4:** Full workflow wide shot (establishes complete system)
- **Slides 5-7:** Zoomed sections showing workflow stages
  - RED = Data extraction/scraping
  - GREEN = Analysis/intelligence
  - BLUE = Output/publishing

**Implementation:**
1. Access n8n via browser automation
2. Zoom to show all labeled sections
3. Screenshot full view
4. Crop focused regions for detail views
5. Resize to 1080x1920 (9:16)

**Text overlay:** Place in opposite corners from workflow area, high contrast

**Documentation:** `CAROUSEL_WORKFLOW_SCREENSHOTS.md`


## Cost Optimization (Priority - Feb 2026)

**Duncan's Directive:** "Always find ways to optimize our processes and reduce costs."

**Current Status:**
- Default model: Gemini 3 Flash Preview ($0.075/$0.30 per 1M tokens)
- 90% cheaper than Claude Sonnet
- Target: <$5/day for normal operations

**Key Strategies:**
1. **Batch operations** - Process multiple items in one script
2. **Local tools first** - Avoid API calls when possible
3. **Cheap sub-agents** - Spawn Gemini for routine tasks
4. **Smart caching** - Save and reuse results
5. **Memory efficiency** - Use memory_search, not full MEMORY.md reads

**Tools Created:**
- `batch_image_styler.py` - 50-70% savings on multi-image tasks
- `daily_cost_tracker.py` - Monitor spending per model
- Cost optimization guide: `COST_OPTIMIZATION.md`

**Before Every Task:**
- Can this use Gemini instead of Claude?
- Can I batch multiple operations?
- Is there a local tool instead of API?
- Do I really need to re-read this file?

**Red Flags:** Multiple small reads, repeated searches, using expensive models for simple tasks
**Green Flags:** Batched operations, memory search, local processing, cheap sub-agents


## Operator Mindset (Feb 2026)

**Core directive from Duncan:** "Figure it out."

When given a task:
1. "I can't" is not vocabulary - if you don't know, learn NOW
2. Search docs, tutorials, reverse engineer, inspect APIs
3. Try 3+ approaches before declaring impossible
4. Operators ship results, not excuses
5. Someone on internet has done it - find them, adapt it

**Application:** When hitting auth/API issues, exhaust approaches before asking. Web search, fetch docs, read source.

---

## Modular Architecture First (Feb 2026)

**Standing directive:** Always work modular. No more monolithic scripts.

**Process (every task):**
1. Identify repeatable subtasks
2. Create single-purpose modules (<150 lines)
3. Build config-driven orchestrators
4. Each module does ONE thing well

**Structure:**
- `core_function.py` - Reusable utility (e.g., `nano_banana.py`)
- `config.json` - Data, not code
- `orchestrator.py` - Calls utilities in sequence
- `README.md` - Documentation

**Benefits:**
- Sub-agents load only what they need
- Easy debugging (swap individual pieces)
- No API call duplication
- Faster iteration (change config, not code)

**Locked in AGENTS.md** as permanent operating procedure

## Process Documentation (Feb 2026)

**Standing permission from Duncan:** "If our discussions improve one of our processes feel free to update those files"

**When to update process docs:**
- New pattern discovered during work
- Duncan provides feedback that changes approach
- Fallback strategy needed after failures
- Better way found to solve recurring problem

**Process doc files:**
- `CAROUSEL_WORKFLOW_SCREENSHOTS.md` - Workflow screenshot capture
- `IMAGE_STYLING_GUIDE.md` - Text overlay styling system
- `IMAGE_HOSTING.md` - Image upload fallback chain
- `SKILL_SOCIAL_IMAGE_GENERATOR.md` - Character reference generation
- `COST_OPTIMIZATION.md` - LLM cost reduction strategies

**Format:** Clear headings, code examples, anti-patterns (❌ Don't), established patterns (✅ Do)

**Goal:** Capture improvements in real-time so we don't repeat failed approaches

---

## Cost Optimization (Standing Priority)

**Duncan's directive:** "Always find ways to optimize and reduce costs."

**Current setup:**
- Primary: Gemini 3 Flash Preview ($0.075/$0.30 per 1M tokens) - 90% cheaper than Sonnet
- Target: <$5/day for normal operations

**Before every task:**
- Can this use Gemini instead of Claude/Opus?
- Can I batch multiple operations?
- Local tool instead of API?
- Do I need to re-read this file?

**Memory system:** Use memory_search + memory_get instead of full file reads

## Image Styling System (Feb 2026)

**Template established:** TikTok Carousel #001

**Style signature:**
- White text + drop shadow (NOT outline)
- Roboto font
- Left-aligned, 80px offset
- Smart positioning (text over buildings/open space, not subjects)
- Darkened backgrounds (15-35% brightness reduction)
- Condensed copy (25-33% less)
- NO background boxes, NO emojis

**Multi-platform:** Generate once (9:16), auto-crop to Instagram (4:5) + Twitter (16:9)
- Script: resize_carousel_multiplatform.py
- Saves 90% cost vs triple generation

**Docs:** IMAGE_STYLING_GUIDE.md

## Carousel #002: Comment Content Engine (Feb 2026)

**Status:** Complete and uploaded to Notion
**Notion Page:** https://www.notion.so/Carousel-002-The-Comment-Content-Engine-307f259c0f17816bbea5cdb40e07a77c
**Files:** `/data/.openclaw/workspace/carousel-002-final/slide-01-final.png` through `slide-08-final.png`

**Story:** "How The Comment Content Engine turned audience questions into 110K followers in 12 months"

**Structure (8 slides — old format, now superseded by 7-slide standard):**
1. Hook - Casual Duncan at coffee shop ✅
2. Problem - Frustrated creator at desk ✅
3. Mechanism - Full workflow screenshot ✅
4. How it works - Zoomed workflow (RED extraction) ✅
5. Key insight - Confident Duncan explaining ✅
6. Proof - Successful Duncan ✅
7. System - Full workflow screenshot ✅
8. CTA - Welcoming Duncan ✅

**⚠️ As of Feb 14, 2026: All future carousels use the 7-slide standard (see CAROUSEL_PROCESS.md).**

**Mix:** Character images + real n8n workflow screenshots + infographic

**Key Pattern:** Workflow screenshots on slide 3, infographic on slide 4 (ALWAYS)

**Text Scaling Solution:** 0.82× scale factor for 4:5 vs 9:16 to maintain equivalent visual impact
- 9:16 headline (66px) → 4:5 headline (54px) = same ~3.4% visual weight

**CTA / Default Caption:** Comment "AI", and I'll send you my 30 best automations.

**Image Hosting:** Uploaded to imgur.com after 0x0.st/pomf.lain.la failed (403 errors)

**Format Fix (Feb 14):** Initially uploaded in wrong format (9:16 TikTok) instead of 4:5 Instagram/Twitter. Built format validation system to prevent future mismatches.

## Format Validation System (Feb 2026)

**Created:** Feb 14, 2026 in response to Carousel #002 format mismatch
**Problem:** Delivered 9:16 format (1080x1920) when 4:5 format (1080x1350) was required
**Solution:** Built automated validation system

**Utilities:**
1. **format_validator.py** (143 lines) - Validates against gold standards
   - Dimensions (exact match check)
   - Aspect ratio detection (4:5, 9:16, 16:9)
   - Text length validation (catches verbose filler)
   - Copy specificity check (flags vague language)
   
2. **resize_to_format.py** (60 lines) - Converts to proper format
   - 4:5 (1080x1350 Instagram/Twitter)
   - 9:16 (1080x1920 TikTok)
   - 16:9 (1920x1080 YouTube/LinkedIn)
   - Center crop, LANCZOS resampling

**Workflow (MANDATORY):**
1. Generate slides
2. **Validate format** (format_validator.py) ← BEFORE upload
3. Fix if needed (resize_to_format.py)
4. Upload to hosting
5. Update Notion

**Usage:**
```bash
# Validate entire carousel
python3 format_validator.py carousel-002-final/

# Convert to Instagram format
python3 resize_to_format.py input.png output.png 4:5
```
