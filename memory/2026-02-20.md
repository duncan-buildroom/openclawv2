# 2026-02-20

- Set up Telegram channel, paired user 1709288760 (Duncan)
- Configured SOUL.md as orchestrator agent
- Sub-agent types: briefer, carousel, threads
- Bootstrap complete

## Agent Architecture Setup
- Reorganized all agent folders into `/agents/` directory
- Configured 13 sub-agents in OpenClaw config:
  - briefer, carousel, threads, coder, imgen, leadmagnet, linkedin, publisher, reddit, repurpose, roadto1m, skoolposts, trendanalyst
- Model assignments following cost optimization:
  - Gemini Flash (default): briefer, threads, linkedin, publisher, reddit, repurpose, roadto1m, skoolposts, imgen
  - Claude Sonnet 4.5 (quality): carousel, coder, leadmagnet, trendanalyst
- Created AGENTS_README.md documenting full architecture
- Updated SOUL.md with complete sub-agent delegation rules
- All committed to GitHub

## Model Update
- Changed all sub-agents from mixed (Gemini/Sonnet) to **Claude Sonnet 4.5** exclusively
- Orchestrator remains on Gemini Flash for cost-effective routing
- Trade-off: higher cost for better quality on all production content

## Skills & Reference Materials Organized
- **imgen agent** received:
  - `image-generation.md` - gpt-image-1.5 prompt templates for photo-realistic iPhone-style carousel images
  - `reference-photos/public_url.txt` - Duncan's reference photo (https://i.imgur.com/Le0GqzJ.jpeg)
- **carousel agent** received:
  - `tiktok-carousel-competitive-analysis.md` - Research on top automation carousel accounts, viral hook patterns
  - `tiktok-content-plan.md` - Duncan's TikTok profile analysis, 15 content briefs, pattern analysis
  - `tiktok-slideshow.md` - TikTok carousel production guide
- **utilities/** (workspace-level):
  - `performance-tracker.md` - Post performance tracking system for TikTok carousels
  - `screenshot-capture.md` - Browser automation capture tool
- Updated TOOLS.md in both agents to reference new files
- All committed to GitHub

## Memory Files Integration (9pm)
- Received comprehensive MEMORY.md from Duncan (60KB+ of context)
- Received 15 daily memory files (Feb 12-19, 2026)
- Placed MEMORY.md at workspace root (orchestrator's long-term memory)
- Extracted daily files to memory/ folder
- **Security upgrade:** Moved all credentials from MEMORY.md to .env
  - Google API Key, Notion Token, Blotato API Key, n8n instance
  - Updated TOOLS.md to document all available credentials
  - .env is gitignored — never committed
- MEMORY.md now contains full context:
  - Duncan's profile, business, communication style
  - All 13 sub-agents and their purposes
  - Active projects, workflows, established patterns
  - Cost optimization strategies, proof points
  - Team info, technical stack, funnel details
- All committed to GitHub (credentials safe in gitignored .env)

## Claude Mac Subscription Auth (9:09pm)
- Configured Claude Max setup-token as primary authentication
- Auth profile: anthropic:default (OAuth)
- Fallback: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY environment variable (API key)
- Priority order: setup-token → API key (automatic on rate limits/409 errors)
- Verified in auth-profiles.json: anthropic:default=OAuth active
- Cost savings: Uses Duncan's Claude Max subscription instead of burning API credits

## Script Credential Migration (9:20pm)
- Audited 50+ Python scripts across all agents for hardcoded credentials
- Found and fixed 16 scripts with broken credential loading:
  - **10 imgen scripts:** Changed quoted strings to `os.getenv("GOOGLE_API_KEY")`
  - **6 other scripts:** Changed `$NOTION_TOKEN` shell syntax to `os.getenv("NOTION_TOKEN")`
  - **1 file-based token:** Changed file reading to `os.getenv()` (trendanalyst)
- All scripts now read from `.env` environment variables
- Zero hardcoded API keys remaining
- Scripts affected:
  - imgen: nano_banana.py, build_carousel_006.py, fix_carousel_006.py, fix_carousel_006_v2.py, generate_carousel_final.py, generate_carousel_v2.py, generate_v4_base_v3.py, generate_v4_base_v4.py, v4_pipeline.py, v4_pipeline_final.py
  - briefer: daily_briefing.py
  - linkedin: get_linkedin_db_schema.py, push_linkedin_post.py, push_11agent_posts.py
  - leadmagnet: push_lead_magnet.py
  - trendanalyst: push_analysis.py
