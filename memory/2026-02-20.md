- Set up Telegram channel, paired user 1709288760 (Duncan)
- Configured SOUL.md as orchestrator agent
- Sub-agent types: briefer, carousel, threads
- Bootstrap complete

## Agent Architecture Setup
- Reorganized all agent folders into `/agents/` directory
- Configured 13 sub-agents in OpenClaw config:
  - briefer, carousel, threads, coder, imgen, leadmagnet, linkedin, publisher, reddit, repurpose, roadto1m, skoolposts, trendanalyst
- Model assignments following cost optimization:
  - Gemini Flash (default): briefer, threads, linkedin, publisher, reddit, repurpose, roadto1m, skoolposts, imgen
  - Claude Sonnet 4.5 (quality): carousel, coder, leadmagnet, trendanalyst
- Created AGENTS_README.md documenting full architecture
- Updated SOUL.md with complete sub-agent delegation rules
- All committed to GitHub

## Model Update
- Changed all sub-agents from mixed (Gemini/Sonnet) to **Claude Sonnet 4.5** exclusively
- Orchestrator remains on Gemini Flash for cost-effective routing
- Trade-off: higher cost for better quality on all production content
