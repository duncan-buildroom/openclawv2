# 2026-02-18 — Road to $1M Strategy Session

## Unified Notion Database

**Road to $1M DB:** `30bf259c-0f17-8138-b849-f25efdc0b4b0`
**URL:** https://www.notion.so/30bf259c0f178138b849f25efdc0b4b0
**Parent:** 🏗️ Products & Builds (`307f259c-0f17-81b0-bb00-cdd934beb7c8`)

**Properties (clean):** Topic (title), Day (number), Date, Bucket (select), Hook (rich_text), Deliverable (rich_text), Deliverable Link (URL), Status (select: Planned/Scripted/Filmed/Posted), Satellite (multi-select)

**Page body template (inside each day):**
- 📱 Short-Form Script (callout block)
- 🐦 X / Twitter
- 💼 LinkedIn
- 🏠 Skool Posts
- 🔴 Reddit
- 📸 Carousel
- 🎬 YouTube

No more separate databases for X threads, LinkedIn, carousels. All new content goes in this unified DB. Old DBs stay as archives.

## Bio/Profile Updates (Feb 18)

**X/Twitter bio (final):**
Ex. Apple, PlayStation, Nissan | 110K followers in 12 months | Teaching 2,000+ to build an audience using AI. Everything I build, you get 👇
Link: skool.com/buildroom

**Instagram bio (updated):**
🚀 | 110K followers in 12 months with AI
🔥 | New leads + 1500 followers in 49 days
🎯 | Everything I build, you get
⬇️ | Join The Build Room

**LinkedIn (updated):**
Headline: Ex-Apple, PlayStation, Nissan → Building a $1M personal brand with AI. Everything I build, you get.
Link label: "Join The Build Room 🚀"

**Platform-specific link descriptions:**
- TikTok: "Everything I build, you get." (low intent, curiosity)
- YouTube: "New leads + 1,500 followers in 49 days" (high intent)
- X: "Everything I build, you get." (discovery)
- Instagram: "New leads + 1,500 followers in 49 days" (higher intent, converters)
- LinkedIn: "Join The Build Room 🚀" (professional)

## CTA Strategy (Locked In)

**ALL platforms:** "The Build Room, link in bio." One destination. No exceptions.
**Exception granted:** Claude 4.6 Prompt Pack LinkedIn post only — "comment PROMPTS" CTA. Last time we do this.
**Key line:** "Whatever I build, you get it. Inside The Build Room. Along with everything else I've already built."
**Updated agent files:** carousel, leadmagnet, linkedin, publisher, skoolposts, threads, roadto1m, CAROUSEL_PROCESS.md — all "comment AI" references replaced.

## Email Strategy Decision

- NOT a priority right now. Duncan is in growth mode, not nurture mode.
- ManyChat "comment AI" triggers on old posts continue running passively
- No email CTA in new content
- Revisit email when approaching $50K/mo or launching something beyond Skool
- Retargeting play: Skool page pixel (Google Ads AW-11407973572) catches bouncers → retarget to leads.buildroom.ai email capture

## Tweet Queue System

- **post_due_tweets.sh** checks queue every 30 min (cron `75d54d9e`)
- Reads tweet_queue.json, posts any past-due tweets via tweepy
- Logs to posted_tweets.json
- Today: 4 tweets queued, 2 posted so far, 2 remaining (1:50pm, 4pm)

## Skool Course Layout (Reorganized)

Row 1: Welcome Start Here | Brand Launch Challenge | Road to $1M
Row 2: Month 1 | Month 2 | Month 3
Row 3: Month 4 | Month 5 | Live Coaching + Q&A
Row 4: TrendJacker | Engagement Vault | Surprise Mystery Module
Row 5: Resource Library | Tech Toolbox | $2M in Deals

Road to $1M = new daily deliverables (living library)
Resource Library = archive of pre-series workflows/templates

## X API Rate Limits

Free tier: ~3 tweets per 15-min window. 21 daily engagement replies cause delays.
Potential upgrade: Basic tier ($100/mo) removes bottleneck. Not urgent yet.

## 49 Days vs 30 Days Guarantee

Duncan's real number is 49 days. Banner currently says 30. Decision: keep 49 because it's real and the specificity IS the proof. Odd numbers stand out. Update banner to match.
