## Skool Classroom Formatting (Day 2)
- **Line Break Protocol:** Every sentence must be its own paragraph (`<p>` tag in Skool) to create natural spacing.
- **Resource Management:** Links must NEVER be inline or raw URLs in body text. They must be added via the "Resource Link" section at the bottom of the Skool module.
- **Agent vs. Chat Distinction:** Duncan is emphasizing the shift from "ChatGPT prompts" (manual chat) to "Agent Prompts" (systemic automation/execution).
- **Positioning:** Content for The Build Room should frame deliverables as "System Prompts" or "Logic Engines" for agents, rather than just chat prompts. It's about goal-oriented execution, tool use, and distribution.

## Content Operations
- **Thread Draft (Feb 18):** "I replaced my entire content team with 7 AI agents" thread drafted (12 tweets).
- **CTA Rule:** Stick to "The Build Room, link in bio" for conversion platforms; "Comment AI" is for discovery platforms (IG/TikTok) to trigger the ManyChat/GHL funnel.
