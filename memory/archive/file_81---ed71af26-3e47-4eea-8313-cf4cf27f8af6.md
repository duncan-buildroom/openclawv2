# Evening Session — Feb 18, 2026

## Skool System Finalized
- **29 communities** total (not 12), all slugs resolved except 3 dropped
- **AI Automation Society = 260.9K members** (Nate Herk) — biggest audience, exact ICP, daily posting
- Dedicated **Skool Posts Notion DB**: `30cf259c-0f17-81a9-ae1f-de9720b5cb64` (under 🏗️ Products & Builds)
- Skool agent SOUL.md rewritten with all 13 active communities, tiers, voice rules, commenting system
- **Daily Skool cron** (`77d52982`): 8am EST, 7 posts + 3-5 comment drafts, browser scans for comment targets

### Active Posting Tiers (Duncan-approved)
- **Daily:** Build Room, AI Automation Society (260.9K), Synthesizer (35.7K), Jack's (1.9K)
- **2-3x/week:** Maker School (2.1K/$184), BBC, AIpreneurs, GOOSIFY, Magnetic Memberships, RoboNuggets
- **1-2x/week:** AI Automation Mastery, Chase AI, Skoolers (active owner), YouTube Blueprint (active owner Dylan Reynolds)

### Corrected Slugs from Duncan
- Build Room (free) = /free (no longer exists, dropped)
- RoboNuggets = /robonuggets-free
- AI Automation Mastery = /ai-automation-mastery-group
- Kourse (Free) = /free-course
- Maker School = /makerschool (Nick Saraev, $184/mo)

## New Crons Added
- **Daily Skool Posts** (`77d52982`): 8am, 7 posts + comments, isolated
- **Daily LinkedIn Post** (`408d839a`): 8:30am, native text post + 2 alt hooks, isolated

## 6pm Check-in Overhauled
- Was failing due to `claude-sonnet-4-6` model string — fixed to `claude-sonnet-4-5`
- **Now proactive**: reads memory files, determines topic itself, builds full Notion day page with all 8 platform sections. Only asks Duncan if genuinely unsure.
- Duncan: "Instead of asking me at 6, determine if you have enough context to figure it out yourself."

## Model String Bug
- `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6` and `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5-20250514` both rejected as "model not allowed"
- Only `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5` works for cron model overrides
- Morning briefing cron also patched to `claude-sonnet-4-5`

## LinkedIn Strategy Decision
- Video performing poorly on LinkedIn
- **Decision:** Text-first native posts (sweet spot) + lead magnets for list building + video keeps running passively
- If video still underperforms in 3 weeks, kill it and go text-only
- Daily LinkedIn cron generates hook-first ~150 word posts based on Road to $1M activity

## X Engagement Gap
- Morning and midday windows returned 0 replies (browser issue finding fresh posts)
- Evening got 6 replies: @gregisenberg, @SahilBloom, @mattshumer_, @levelsio, @tdinh_me, @AlexHormozi
- Should be 21/day — need to investigate morning/midday failure

## Skool Commenting Added
- 3-5 comments/day on other people's posts in Tier 1-2 communities
- Rules: 1-3 sentences, add value, no pitch, no "great post!", same café voice
- Review mode first, then autonomous (same ramp as Reddit)

## Duncan Preferences Confirmed
- "Corn" = cron 🌽
- Skool posts should NOT go in Road to $1M DB — separate DB
- Skoolers + YouTube Blueprint owners are very active — show up consistently
- Duncan chose which 8 communities to add beyond original 5 — trust his judgment on community selection
