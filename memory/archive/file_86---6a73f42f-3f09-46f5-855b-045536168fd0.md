- 7 tweets, narrative arc, Claude 4.6 Prompt Pack
- Hook: "Claude Sonnet 4.6 just dropped. I rebuilt my entire business around it."

**3 Value Tweets Posted (LIVE):**
- https://x.com/DuncanRogoff/status/2023961614102245672 (cost optimization)
- https://x.com/DuncanRogoff/status/2023961623371665903 (traffic > conversion)
- https://x.com/DuncanRogoff/status/2023961632498385138 (lead magnets)
- ⚠️ MISTAKE: Posted all 3 back-to-back. Duncan called it out. NEVER do this again.

**Bio (finalized):**
Ex - Apple, PlayStation, Nissan | AI agency founder | 110K followers in 12 months | Teaching 2,000+ to build an audience using AI 👇

**Tweet Voice Rules (Duncan-approved):**
- Documenting > teaching
- First person, concrete details (say "Claude Opus" not "expensive model")
- Every tweet needs a HOOK ("This one shift 10x'd my growth")
- NEVER post back-to-back. Always use tweet_scheduler.py with 2-4hr random gaps

**Engagement Reply Rules (Duncan-approved):**
- Max 35 words, single paragraph, no line breaks, no em dashes
- 6th grade reading level, coffee-with-a-peer tone
- Dig at real tension, not surface-level. Be concrete.
- Auto-posted, NO approval needed
- 3 windows (9am/1pm/6pm), 7 replies each, rotated across different creators

## Blotato API

Still returning 401 after Duncan reconnected. Key may need regenerating from dashboard. Using tweepy + tweet_scheduler.py as fallback for X posting.

## Road to $1M — Full System (Feb 18)

**Agent:** `roadto1m` (Sonnet 4.6), registered in openclaw.json + AGENTS.md
**Content Calendar:** `agents/roadto1m/CONTENT_CALENDAR.md` (30 days mapped)
**$1M Roadmap Notion:** https://www.notion.so/The-1M-Roadmap-30bf259c0f1781699a8bd9210570b1e3 (Page ID: 30bf259c-0f17-8169-9a8b-d9210570b1e3)
**Content Strategy Notion:** https://www.notion.so/Road-to-1M-Content-Strategy-30bf259c0f1781339bece8901e2d3b93 (Page ID: 30bf259c-0f17-8133-9bec-e8901e2d3b93)

**Series tagline:** "Gatekeeping nothing to $1M"
**Series thesis:** "I'm documenting everything. And giving you everything so you can do it too." (NOT "I'm not teaching, just documenting" — Duncan corrected this, he IS teaching AND documenting)

**Video skeleton:**
1. Hook: "Day X of building a $1M personal brand with AI"
2. Giveaway: "Today I'm giving you [specific asset]" (immediately after hook)
3. Content: one idea, 30-60 seconds
4. Close: "This is in The Build Room. Along with everything else I've already built."

**Day 1 script DONE:** Deliverable = The $1M Roadmap Notion template. ~145 words, 90 sec.

**Cron IDs:**
- Morning Briefing (7am EST): c96ecd79 — upgraded to Sonnet 4.6, reads memory files + Notion + last30days cache
- Road to $1M Check-in (6pm PST / 9pm EST): aa54d56c — asks "what'd you work on today?", suggests Day X topic + deliverable

**Duncan's filming workflow:** Check-in at 6pm → I pick topic + deliverable → Duncan films next day acting like he just did it (retroactive documenting)

**Content strategy covers all channels:**
- TikTok/Reels/Shorts: Day X daily + satellite (money/follower check-ins, quick tips)
- YouTube: Keep tutorials, add Road to $1M deep dives when natural (e.g. "7 AI Agents I'm Using...")
- Instagram: Reels + carousels (1-2/week) + pinned Origin Story
- X: 3-5 tweets/day + 2-3 threads/week + 21 engagement replies/day
- LinkedIn: 3-5 native posts/week
- Reddit: Reply-first (weeks 1-2), original posts week 3+
- Skool: 5 daily value posts + all Day X deliverables

## CTA Strategy Update (Feb 18)

**ALL platforms now point to one destination: The Build Room (skool.com/buildroom)**
- NO more "comment AI" or individual lead magnet CTAs anywhere
- X agent SOUL.md updated
- roadto1m agent already set up with this rule
- Thread CTAs: "The Build Room, link in bio"
- Duncan confirmed: Build Room is $97/mo, NOT free. Never say "every asset is free." Say "every asset I build, you get. Inside The Build Room."
- "The Build Room" always capitalized with "The", always hyperlinked to https://skool.com/buildroom in Notion docs

## Reddit Credentials Needed

- Reddit scanner works (public JSON, no auth)
- CANNOT post replies without Reddit credentials
- Asked Duncan for: username + password + Reddit app (client ID/secret) from reddit.com/prefs/apps
- Also need to space Reddit replies throughout the day (2-3 windows) instead of dumping all at once
- 7 Reddit replies drafted and awaiting approval + credentials to post

## Banner Strategy Decision

- Duncan asked if "building a $1M personal brand with AI" should replace current banner offer
- Advised: KEEP current offer ("new leads + 1,500 followers in 49 days") in banners
- Series hook (Day X, $1M story) catches attention, banner offer converts attention
- They work together: story draws people in, specific promise closes

## Cost

- Feb 17: $17.02 (heavy build day, mostly Opus orchestrator)
- Expected lower going forward, building phase complete

## Em Dash Rule

NEVER use em dashes (—) in ANY content. Use commas instead. All agent files cleaned.

## Road to $1M Series (Feb 18, 2026)

**Agent:** `roadto1m` (Sonnet 4.6)
**Workspace:** `/data/.openclaw/workspace/agents/roadto1m/`
**Content Calendar:** `agents/roadto1m/CONTENT_CALENDAR.md` (30 days mapped)
**Registered:** openclaw.json + AGENTS.md

**Series concept:** "Day X of building a $1M personal brand with AI"
**Tagline:** "Gatekeeping nothing to $1M" (Duncan's equivalent of CatGPT's "making AI unpretentious")
**Goal:** $1M total revenue earned, no deadline. Series runs until he hits it.

**Video skeleton (every video):**
1. Hook: "Day X of building a $1M personal brand with AI"
2. Giveaway: "Today I'm giving you [specific asset]" (IMMEDIATELY after hook)
3. Content: one idea, 30-60 seconds
4. Close: "This is in the Build Room"

**CTA rules (CRITICAL):**
- NO "comment AI" or lead-magnet-style CTAs
- Always: "This is in the Build Room. Link in bio." One destination.
- Occasionally show what's already inside the Build Room as a flex (compound effect)

**Content buckets:** Build, Lesson, Giveaway, Growth, Money (rotating)
**Satellite series (separate videos, no Day X hook):** Money Check-ins, Follower Check-ins, Quick Tips
**Posting:** 1 main series/day + 0-2 satellite as needed

**Duncan's starting numbers (Feb 2026):**
- Skool low ticket: $11,760/mo
- Skool coaching high ticket: $4,899/mo
- YouTube AdSense: $2,500/mo
- Agency: 1 client at $8K/mo (2 months remaining, intentionally few clients)
- Sponsorships: $9,000 from 2 videos (lumpy)
- Affiliate: small
- **Total: ~$27-31K/mo, ~$325-375K annualized**

**Upcoming audience milestones:**
- YouTube: approaching 50K (then 100K)
- TikTok: approaching 75K (then 100K)
- X: approaching 20K
- LinkedIn: approaching 10K
- Build Room: target 3K members

**$1M Roadmap (Notion, Day 1 deliverable):**
- Page: https://www.notion.so/The-1M-Roadmap-30bf259c0f1781699a8bd9210570b1e3
- Page ID: 30bf259c-0f17-8169-9a8b-d9210570b1e3
- DB: Lead Magnets & Offers
- Includes: starting numbers, $1M math, milestones, content system, "Build Your Own Roadmap" ICP framework, the rules

**Origin Story Carousel (pinned IG/TT):**
- Copy done (8 slides, Bay Area imagery)
- Duncan will swap AI images for real photos
- Files: `agents/carousel/origin-story-carousel.json`, `agents/carousel/ORIGIN_STORY.md`

**Key decisions:**
- YouTube Shorts go on MAIN channel (not separate). Shorts feed viewers into tutorials.
- Instagram carousels can't be edited after posting, but numbers change slowly enough that it's fine. New milestones = new carousel.
- Every deliverable lives in Build Room. Series IS the content engine for Build Room resources.
- Duncan can post multiple times/day: 1 main series + satellite content.
