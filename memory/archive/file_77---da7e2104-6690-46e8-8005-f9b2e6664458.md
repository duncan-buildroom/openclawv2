## Telegram sendMessage Fixed

**Problem:** Daily 7am briefing was generating successfully but failing to deliver to Telegram. Error: "Telegram sendMessage is disabled."
**Root cause:** `channels.telegram.actions.sendMessage` was set to `false` in openclaw.json
**Fix:** Patched config to `sendMessage: true`, gateway restarted
**Verified:** Manually sent briefing to Duncan on Telegram, delivered successfully (messageId: 1024)

## Briefing Delivery History
- Feb 13: Failed (no Google/OpenAI API keys in isolated session)
- Feb 14: Failed (same auth issue, then fixed)
- Feb 15: Success (generated) but delivery failed (sendMessage disabled)
- Feb 16: Sent manually after fix, confirmed working. Tomorrow's 7am should auto-deliver.

## Notion DB IDs Updated

Old Lead Magnets DB ID in MEMORY.md (`5c69c085...`) is WRONG — not shared with integration.
**Correct IDs:**
- Lead Magnets & Offers: `140dd3e4-fb8d-4066-9adc-51870ad66f07`
- LinkedIn Posts: `d4266f2c-ed0a-4c5b-8b81-7cb4e2ffad86`
- LinkedIn Posts title property is "Title" not "Name"

## Pipeline Rule Reminder

**CRITICAL:** Every approved lead magnet MUST auto-trigger a LinkedIn post. Don't wait for Duncan to ask. He had to remind me this time — won't happen again.

## YouTube Video Ideas Session

Duncan asked for long-form YouTube ideas. Key insight from conversation:
- **First batch (20 ideas):** Too tech/automation focused, not enough brand-building angle
- **Duncan's correction:** ICP wants to build a profitable personal brand USING AI — tools are the vehicle, not the destination
- **Second batch (10 ideas):** Reframed with brand outcome as the promise, tools as the how
- **Third refinement:** Duncan wants Claude Code / OpenClaw / AntiGravity tie-ins — "show people how to use those tools to get results"
- **Final batch (10 ideas):** Merged trending tools + personal brand outcomes
- **Top picks:** "I Used Claude Code to Build My Entire Content System in One Afternoon" / "The AI Personal Brand Stack: Claude Code + AntiGravity + n8n"
- **CTA alignment matters:** Claude Code carousel clashes with "comment AI for 30 automations" CTA (those are n8n workflows). Keep carousel topics aligned with the funnel.

## Content Strategy Principle (learned today)

**Every title promises a BRAND RESULT. The tool is the how, not the what.**
- Bad: "How to Use Claude Code" (tool-first)
- Good: "I Used Claude Code to Build My Entire Content System" (result-first, tool as proof)
- Duncan's ICP doesn't care about AI agents — they care about getting leads, building authority, escaping the referral trap. AI is just the vehicle.

## LLM Cost Alert
- Feb 15 total: $16.26 — almost entirely Opus ($16.24) from heavy pipeline builds
- Target: <$5/day
- Action: Use Opus sparingly, prefer Sonnet for sub-agent work, Gemini for routine tasks
