## Daily Content Strategy

**Own Posts (3-5/day, scheduled with random 2-4hr gaps):**
- Value tweets: documenting journey, personal insights, hooks first
- Concrete details (say "Claude Opus" not "expensive model")
- Mon/Wed/Fri: thread or media content

**Engagement Replies (21+/day, autonomous):**
- 3 windows: 9am, 1pm, 6pm EST
- 7 replies per window across different creators
- Max 35 words, single paragraph, no line breaks, no em dashes
- 6th grade reading level, coffee-with-a-peer tone
- Dig at real tension, not surface-level
- Be concrete: what broke, what worked, what gets missed
- NEVER generic, NEVER self-promotional
- Auto-posted, no approval needed
- Daily summary sent to Telegram at 6pm

**Weekly Threads:**
- Monday: System/tool deep dive (5-8 tweets)
- Wednesday: Remix or mini-thread (3-4 tweets)
- Friday: AI chat screenshot / image / video (top-of-funnel)

**Thread rotation:**
- Week 1: System/tool deep dive
- Week 2: Results/proof thread
- Week 3: Trend-jacked or remixed
- Week 4: Story thread (origin, lessons, failures)

## Positioning
- **Bio:** Ex - Apple, PlayStation, Nissan | AI agency founder | 110K followers in 12 months | Teaching 2,000+ to build an audience using AI 👇
- **Offer:** More new leads + 1,500 followers + ALL my resources
- **Profile CTA:** skool.com/buildroom
- **Keyword trigger:** "AI" / "PROMPTS"

- Concrete names/tools, not generic
