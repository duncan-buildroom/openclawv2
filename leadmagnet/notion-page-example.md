## Meet Your Team

This isn't AI chat. This is a multi-agent system. One brain, four specialists. Here's who does what:

### 🧠 The Orchestrator
**The routing brain. Never executes — only delegates.**

Handles: Understanding requests, choosing the right specialist, coordinating multi-step workflows

### 🔍 The Researcher
**Your intel engine.**

Handles: Web research, trend analysis, competitive intel, sourced briefs that feed the Writer

### ✍️ The Writer
**Your voice.**

Handles: Social posts, emails, blog posts, landing pages, scripts — ready-to-publish copy

### 📋 The Chief of Staff
**Runs while you sleep.**

Handles: Morning briefings, task tracking, meeting prep, decision logs, blocker flags

### 🔧 The Builder
**Makes it real.**

Handles: Code, automation, system design, debugging — working solutions, not pseudocode

## The Master Prompt

> 📋 **Copy-paste this into your OpenClaw workspace. Everything deploys automatically.**

```
[Full master prompt from JSON would go in this code block]
```

**Setup Instructions:**

1. Create a 'main' agent directory in your OpenClaw workspace
2. Paste each file from the prompt into the corresponding path
3. Update USER.md with your details (name, business, goals, tone)
4. Run your orchestrator agent
5. Start delegating tasks — your agents handle the rest

## How It Works

### The Orchestrator Pattern

Most people use AI like a chatbot. You ask, it answers. That's one brain doing everything.

This system is different. The orchestrator is the brain, but it doesn't execute. It routes.

**Example:**

You say: *"Write a Twitter thread about AI agents."*

Orchestrator thinks: *"That's a writing task. But it needs research first."*

1. Spawns **Researcher**: "Find current AI agent trends, top discussions, use cases."
2. Waits for research output.
3. Spawns **Writer**: "Using this research, write a 10-tweet thread. Hook-first, operator tone."
4. Delivers final thread to you.

**Result:** Better output, faster execution, cleaner context.

Each agent is a specialist. They do one thing extremely well. The orchestrator coordinates them.

## Make It Yours

The default system works out of the box. But the real power comes when you train it on YOUR business.

- [ ] **Update USER.md** — Add your name, business, goals, tone preferences
- [ ] **Feed the Writer your voice** — Paste examples of your best content into memory files
- [ ] **Train the Researcher on your niche** — Add preferred sources and competitors to TOOLS.md
- [ ] **Set up the Chief for daily briefings** — Configure a cron job for 8am daily
- [ ] **Give the Builder your tech stack** — Note preferred languages and deployment targets
- [ ] **Build memory over time** — Let agents log decisions and context in memory files

*You don't have to do all of this on day 1. Start simple. Layer in customization as you go.*

## What to Add Next

When you're ready to scale, add these specialists:

| Agent | Role | When to Add |
|-------|------|-------------|
| **Publisher** | Auto-posts to social, handles scheduling, optimizes timing, tracks analytics | When you're creating content regularly |
| **Designer** | Creates graphics, slide decks, social visuals, brand assets | When you need visual content at scale |
| **Strategist** | Quarterly planning, goal tracking, strategic analysis, market positioning | When you're ready for strategic oversight |
| **Analyst** | Performance tracking, A/B testing, growth metrics, reporting dashboards | When you need data-driven decisions |

> Each agent follows the same pattern: SOUL.md (role) + entry in AGENTS.md (registry). Build what you need, when you need it.
