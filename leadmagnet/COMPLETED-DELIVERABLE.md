## 💡 What Makes This Different

**Most lead magnets:**
- Generic advice ("think about your workflow")
- No code, no templates
- Theoretical, not actionable

**This lead magnet:**
- ✅ Working templates (copy/paste ready)
- ✅ Real code (SOUL.md files, cron configs, Notion formulas)
- ✅ Proof (Duncan's actual system)
- ✅ Meta (created by the system it teaches)

**Result:** Not "how to think about agents." It's "copy these 7 files and you have a working system."
