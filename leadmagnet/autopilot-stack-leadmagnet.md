# The Autopilot Stack — 4 Cron Jobs That Run Your Business While You Sleep

**Copy-paste prompts. Zero manual setup. Your AI does the work.**

---

**Built in 48 hours. Runs 24/7. ~$5/day operating cost.**

---

## Before & After

**BEFORE:**

You wake up. Check Slack. Check email. Scroll Twitter for "research." Check your calendar. Try to remember what you were working on yesterday. Spend 90 minutes just *getting oriented* before you do actual work.

Every. Single. Day.

You're not lazy. You're just doing what every operator does — manually running the operating system of your business inside your head.

**AFTER:**

You wake up. Your phone buzzes. Your AI already sent you a briefing:

- The one metric you're watching today
- What got done yesterday  
- Your top 3 priorities (with time estimates)
- What the AI is handling vs. what needs YOU
- Quick yes/no decisions to unblock work
- 2-3 growth ideas it found while you slept

Your workspace is backed up to GitHub. Your daily log is written. Sunday night, trend research lands in your inbox — fresh intel for Monday.

You didn't do any of it. **It just runs.**

This is my actual system. These 4 cron jobs run my business operations 24/7. I'm giving you the exact prompts I use.

No fluff. No theory. Just copy-paste and let your AI do the work.

## How This Works

Each prompt below is designed for OpenClaw (or similar AI agent platforms). You paste the prompt. Your AI sets up the cron job. Done.

No code. No cron syntax. No manual scheduling. **The AI configures itself.**

Each job runs autonomously — checking data, making decisions, logging outputs, sending you updates. While you sleep, eat, exercise, or actually work on your business.

Here are the 4 jobs:

---

## 1. 🌅 Morning Briefing (7am daily)

**What it does:**  
Every morning at 7am, your AI generates a structured briefing and sends it to you on Telegram. You wake up knowing exactly what to focus on.

**Why it matters:**  
Most operators waste the first hour of their day just *figuring out* what to do. This cuts that to 60 seconds. You read the briefing, make quick decisions, and start executing. No context-switching. No "what was I doing yesterday?" No scroll-paralysis.

### The Briefing Format (7 sections):

- 📊 **One Metric** — single number to watch today
- ✅ **Yesterday** — quick progress recap
- 🎯 **Top 3 Today** — priority tasks with time estimates
- 🔨 **Agent Tasks** — what the AI will work on
- 📋 **Your Tasks** — what YOU need to do
- ❓ **Quick Decisions** — yes/no items to unblock work
- 💡 **Growth Ideas** — 2-3 business opportunities

### 📋 COPY-PASTE PROMPT:

```
Set up a daily morning briefing cron job. Every day at 7am in my timezone, generate a structured briefing with these 7 sections: One Metric to watch, Yesterday's progress recap, Top 3 priorities for today with time estimates, Agent tasks (what you'll work on), My tasks (what I need to do), Quick yes/no decisions to unblock work, and 2-3 growth ideas. Send the full formatted briefing directly to me on Telegram. Keep it concise and direct — no fluff.
```

## 2. 📊 Midnight Daily Tracker (12am daily)

**What it does:**  
At midnight, your AI reviews the day — what got done, what didn't, any important decisions — and logs it. Creates an automatic daily record.

**Why it matters:**  
You'll never ask "wait, when did I decide that?" again. Every decision, blocker, completed task, and open question gets logged automatically. It's like having a chief of staff taking notes in every meeting — except the meeting is your entire day.

**Benefits:**
- Instant recall of past decisions
- Track velocity over time (what's actually getting done?)
- Spot patterns (same blocker 3 days in a row? Fix it.)
- Onboard team members faster ("here's what happened last week")

### 📋 COPY-PASTE PROMPT:

```
Set up a midnight daily tracker cron job. Every day at midnight, review today's conversations and work. Create a daily summary with: what I completed today, what you completed, any decisions made, blockers or open questions, and status of active projects. Save this to a daily log file (memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md). Keep it concise.
```

---

## 3. 💾 GitHub Workspace Backup (12am daily)

**What it does:**  
At midnight, your AI automatically commits and pushes your entire workspace to a GitHub repo. Your agent configs, memory, scripts — all backed up automatically.

**Why it matters:**  
Your AI's memory IS your business infrastructure. Agent configs, task logs, decision history, automated scripts — if you lose that, you're back to square one. This runs silently every night. You never think about it. It just works.

> *I've never lost a day of work. Not once. My agent's entire memory is versioned, backed up, and recoverable. Worst case? I spin up a new instance, clone the repo, and I'm back online in 5 minutes.*

### 📋 COPY-PASTE PROMPT:

```
Set up an automatic GitHub backup cron job. Every day at midnight, commit and push the entire workspace to my GitHub repo. Make sure there's a .gitignore that excludes sensitive files (API keys, tokens, secrets, personal data, logs). The commit message should include today's date. This runs silently — only alert me if it fails.
```

## 4. 🔍 Weekly Trend Research (Sunday 11pm)

**What it does:**  
Every Sunday night, your AI researches trends in your niche so you start Monday with fresh intel. Saves findings to a research file you can reference all week.

**Why it matters:**  
Most people say they'll "do research" and never do it. Or they do it reactively ("oh shit, competitor just launched X"). This makes research *automatic*. Every Monday you wake up with a brief on what's trending, what competitors are doing, and where the opportunities are.

**What it finds:**
- Trending topics in your niche (Reddit, Twitter/X, YouTube)
- Emerging opportunities (gaps in the market, underserved audiences)
- Competitor moves (new launches, pricing changes, messaging shifts)
- Content ideas for the week (based on what's getting engagement)

### 📋 COPY-PASTE PROMPT:

```
Set up a weekly trend research cron job. Every Sunday at 11pm, research the latest trends, discussions, and opportunities in my niche. Search Reddit, Twitter/X, YouTube, and industry sources. Compile findings into a structured brief with: trending topics, emerging opportunities, competitor moves, and content ideas for the week. Save to a weekly research file. Focus on actionable insights, not generic news.
```

## This Is My Actual System

I'm not selling you theory. These 4 jobs run on my OpenClaw instance right now. They've been running 24/7 for months.

**The build:** 48 hours from idea to fully operational.

**The cost:** ~$5/day in AI API calls (Claude Sonnet). Less than a coffee.

**The result:** I wake up oriented. My workspace is backed up. My daily logs write themselves. I start every week with fresh research. And I never have to think about any of it.

This is what AI agents are actually for — not replacing you, but handling the repetitive ops work that drains your energy before you even start.
