Same vague promises.\n\nYou need two things to stand out: an unfair advantage people can see, and a one-liner that makes them want to follow you.\n\nThis layer gives you both.\n\n---\n\nPrompt 1: Unfair Advantage Finder\n\nThis prompt finds what makes you different. Not what you think is special. What the market will actually care about.\n\nCopy this into ChatGPT or Claude:\n\n\"I help [who you help] with [what you do]. My background: [list your experience, skills, industries you've worked in, results you've gotten]. Find 3 unfair advantages I have that competitors can't easily copy. Make them specific and provable.\"\n\nExample output:\n- You worked at Apple for 10 years (credibility no one else has)\n- You built a system that cut research time by 80% (specific result)\n- You grew to 110K followers with zero ad spend (proof of method)\n\nPick the one that makes people think \"I want what they have.\"\n\n---\n\nPrompt 2: One-Liner Generator\n\nThis turns your advantage into a bio people read and click Follow immediately.\n\nCopy this:\n\n\"My unfair advantage: [paste the one you picked]. Write 5 different one-liner bios that show this advantage. Make them short. Make them concrete. No fluff. Show the outcome, not the process.\"\n\nExample output:\n- Built 110K followers in 12 months. Zero ads. Here's the system.\n- I turn your expertise into content that brings you clients.\n- Former Apple creative. Now I teach people to build audiences with AI.\n\nPick the one that sounds most like you.\n\n---\n\nNow you know what to say. Here's how to say it without spending 10 hours a week.",

Write 10 hooks for this topic. Make them short. Make them surprising. Use these patterns: bold claim, question that makes them curious, story opening, contrarian take, specific number.\"\n\nExample output:\n- Most people waste 10 hours a week on content. Here's how to do it in one.\n- I grew to 110K followers without posting every day. Here's what I did instead.\n- You don't need more content. You need better distribution.\n\nPick the one that makes you want to keep reading.\n\n---\n\nPrompt 4: Carousel Outliner\n\nThis turns one idea into a 5-10 slide carousel in 3 minutes.\n\nCopy this:\n\n\"Topic: [your topic]. Hook: [paste the hook you picked]. Create a carousel outline with 7 slides. Slide 1: the hook. Slides 2-6: one idea per slide, each builds on the last. Slide 7: clear takeaway. Keep each slide to 1-2 sentences max.\"\n\nExample output:\nSlide 1: I built 110K followers in 12 months. Zero ads.\nSlide 2: Most people post and pray. I built a system.\nSlide 3: Layer 1: Position yourself so people want to follow.\nSlide 4: Layer 2: Create content in batches, not daily.\nSlide 5: Layer 3: Post once, show up on 6 platforms.\nSlide 6: The system compounds. Every post works harder.\nSlide 7: Build once. Distribute everywhere.\n\nDrop this into Canva. You have a carousel.\n\n---\n\nPrompt 5: Video Script\n\nThis writes a 60-second script you can read on camera.\n\nCopy this:\n\n\"Topic: [your topic]. Write a 60-second video script. Start with a hook that stops the scroll. Middle: one clear point with a specific example. End: one-sentence takeaway. Write it like I'm talking to a friend. Short sentences. No fluff.\"\n\nExample output:\n\"Most people think you need to post every day to grow. You don't. I post 3 times a week and grew to 110K followers in a year. Here's what I do instead: I create one piece of content and turn it into 6. One video becomes a carousel, a thread, a LinkedIn post, a newsletter. Same idea, different formats. You're not creating more. You're distributing smarter. Build once. Show up everywhere.\"\n\nRead it on your phone. Post it as a Reel.\n\n---\n\nPrompt 6: Voice Calibration\n\nThis makes AI sound like you, not a robot.\n\nCopy this:\n\n\"Here are 3 things I've written: [paste 3 of your posts, emails, or tweets]. Analyze my voice. Tell me: sentence length, word choice, tone, how I structure ideas. Then rewrite this post in my voice: [paste a draft].\"\n\nExample output:\n\"Your voice: Short sentences. Concrete examples. You say 'Here's what I did' not 'Here's what you should do.' You use numbers and proof, not adjectives. You write like you talk.\"\n\nNow every post sounds like you wrote it.\n\n---\n\nYou've got content. Now make it show up everywhere.",

My topic focus: [what you help with]. Create a weekly content calendar. Show me: what to post, which platform, and what format. Make sure each post supports the others and builds momentum.\"\n\nExample output:\nMonday: LinkedIn carousel on positioning\nTuesday: TikTok video using the carousel idea\nWednesday: Twitter thread expanding on one slide\nThursday: Instagram post with a client story\nFriday: YouTube short summarizing the week's ideas\n\nYou're not guessing. You have a plan.\n\n---\n\n7-Day Quick Start\n\nHere's how to use this system starting today:\n\nDay 1: Run Unfair Advantage Finder and One-Liner Generator. Update your bio on every platform.\n\nDay 2: Run Hook Generator. Pick your 3 favorite hooks. These become your next 3 posts.\n\nDay 3: Take hook 1. Run Carousel Outliner. Create the carousel. Post it.\n\nDay 4: Take the same carousel idea. Run Video Script. Record it. Post as a Reel or TikTok.\n\nDay 5: Run Multi-Platform Repurposer on your carousel. Schedule the outputs for next week.\n\nDay 6: Run Weekly Calendar for the following week. You now have a plan.\n\nDay 7: Run Voice Calibration on 3 old posts. Save the voice analysis. Use it every time you create content.\n\nIn 7 days you'll have: a new bio, 2 pieces of content posted, 6 pieces scheduled, and a system you can repeat every week.\n\nPeople will start DMing you asking how you can help them.",
