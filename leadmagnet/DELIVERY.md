# AI Dream Team Lead Magnet — COMPLETE ✅

## What Was Built

A complete, working lead magnet system containing:

1. **Master Prompt** — Copy-paste deployment for 5-agent system (orchestrator + 4 specialists)
2. **Notion Page Design Specs** — Section-by-section blueprint ready to build in Notion

## File Output

**`ai-dream-team-leadmagnet.json`** — Structured JSON containing:
- Complete master prompt with all SOUL.md files
- AGENTS.md registry for orchestrator
- Individual SOUL.md for each sub-agent (researcher, writer, chief, builder)
- TOOLS.md files for each agent
- Full Notion page design specs with content for each section

## The System

### Agents Included

1. **Orchestrator** (`/main/`)
   - Routes tasks, never executes
   - Coordinates multi-agent workflows
   - Keeps context tight

2. **Researcher** (`/researcher/`)
   - Web research, trend analysis, competitive intel
   - Outputs structured briefs with sources

3. **Writer** (`/writer/`)
   - All content formats (posts, emails, threads, landing pages)
   - Adapts to user's voice over time

4. **Chief of Staff** (`/chief/`)
   - Daily briefings, task tracking, meeting prep
   - "Runs while you sleep" agent

5. **Builder** (`/builder/`)
   - Code, automation, technical implementation
   - Ships working code, not pseudocode

### Key Features

✅ **Actually works** — Real SOUL.md content, not placeholders
✅ **Generic** — No platform-specific dependencies
✅ **Day 1 ready** — Immediately useful out of the box
✅ **Upgrade paths** — Clear roadmap for adding Publisher, Designer, Strategist, Analyst agents
✅ **OpenClaw-native** — Built for OpenClaw patterns but framework-agnostic

## Notion Page Structure

1. **Hero** — "Deploy your AI team in 60 seconds"
2. **Meet Your Team** — Visual breakdown of 5 agents
3. **The Master Prompt** — Copyable block with full system
4. **How It Works** — Orchestrator pattern explained simply
5. **Customization Guide** — Train agents on your business
6. **Upgrade Paths** — What to add next
7. **Proof Points** — Duncan's stats (6 agents, $5/day, 110K followers)
8. **CTA** — "Get live help in The Build Room"

## Tone & Style

- **Hormozi-compressed**: Direct, no fluff, operator energy
- **Proof-forward**: Real stats, real system Duncan uses
- **Action-oriented**: "Here's exactly what I use. Copy it."

## Next Steps

### To Use the Master Prompt:
1. Open `ai-dream-team-leadmagnet.json`
2. Copy each file content from the `masterPrompt.files` object
3. Create corresponding directories and files in OpenClaw workspace
4. Update USER.md with user details
5. Deploy and start using

### To Build the Notion Page:
1. Open `ai-dream-team-leadmagnet.json`
2. Follow `notionPageDesign.sections` array
3. Each section has content + Notion formatting instructions
4. Build section by section in Notion
5. Use design notes for visual consistency

## Why This Works

- **Specialist agents** = each does one thing extremely well
- **Real configuration** = not theory, actual working system
- **Copy-paste simple** = no complex setup, just deploy
- **Scales with user** = start simple, add agents as needed

## Proof Points Included

- Duncan runs 6 agents 24/7
- ~$5/day operating cost
- Replaces VA + designer + social media manager
- Built in ~2 weeks
- 110K+ followers grown using these systems
