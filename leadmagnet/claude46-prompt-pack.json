What each agent does — be specific (inputs, outputs, decision rules)\n2. How agents hand off work to each other (what triggers the next agent)\n3. What I review before anything goes out (human-in-the-loop checkpoints)\n4. What's fully automated and never needs my attention\n5. Exact tools to use for each agent with setup instructions\n6.
