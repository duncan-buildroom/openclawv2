You're just doing what every operator does — manually running the operating system of your business inside your head.\n\n**AFTER:**\n\nYou wake up. Your phone buzzes. Your AI already sent you a briefing:\n\n- The one metric you're watching today\n- What got done yesterday  \n- Your top 3 priorities (with time estimates)\n- What the AI is handling vs. what needs YOU\n- Quick yes/no decisions to unblock work\n- 2-3 growth ideas it found while you slept\n\nYour workspace is backed up to GitHub. Your daily log is written. Sunday night, trend research lands in your inbox — fresh intel for Monday.\n\nYou didn't do any of it. **It just runs.**\n\nThis is my actual system.
