You approve it. No exceptions.\n\n───────────────────────\n\n### 🔴 Red Zone: Never Fully Automate\nHigh-risk tasks where full automation creates unacceptable exposure.\n\n- Anything involving client financial data\n- Legal documents or contract modifications\n- Access to production databases or client systems\n- Password or credential management\n- Deleting files or data\n- Direct communication with high-value clients\n\n> ⚠️ Critical: Just because you CAN automate something doesn't mean you SHOULD.

API Key Audit**\n- [ ] Every key has minimum required permissions (not admin)\n- [ ] Keys rotate every 90 days\n- [ ] Keys stored in environment variables, never hardcoded\n- [ ] Deactivated keys are deleted, not disabled\n\n**3. Data Access Map**\n- [ ] You can list every system the agent reads from\n- [ ] You can list every system the agent writes to\n- [ ] Client data is separated from internal data\n- [ ] Agent cannot access previous clients' information\n\n**4. Output Review Process**\n- [ ] Yellow Zone tasks have mandatory human review\n- [ ] Log exists of what agent generated vs. what you approved\n- [ ] Failed tasks notify you immediately\n- [ ] Agent cannot publish or send without approval\n\n**5. Kill Switch Test**\n- [ ] You know how to immediately disable the agent\n- [ ] Disabling doesn't require technical knowledge\n- [ ] You tested the kill switch in last 30 days\n- [ ] Backup person can kill it if you're unavailable\n\n> 🔥 If you can't check all 5 categories, don't deploy.
